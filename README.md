# Quixta

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the provided Figma design into a fully functional, responsive web application using:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- GitHub
- Vercel
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for advanced animations
- Shatchn (custom animation utility)

The final application is deployed on Vercel, and the source code is hosted on GitHub.

## 📐 Figma Design
Access the design here:
👉 Figma Design (replace with your actual Figma link)

## 📝 Requirements

### Design Implementation
- Recreate the layout and components exactly as per the Figma design.
- Fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid inline styles or external CSS files.
- Ensure accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA roles).

### Functionality
- Implement all interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals, etc.) as per the design.
- Smooth transitions and animations using Tailwind CSS utilities, GSAP, and Shatchn.

### Code Quality
- Clean, modular, and reusable code.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- Best practices for component structure and state management.
- Well-commented and easy to understand code.

### Version Control
- Git repository initialized.
- Regular commits with meaningful messages.
- Source code pushed to GitHub.
